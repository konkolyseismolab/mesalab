# --- Required Input/Output Paths ---
# These are essential for the program to find your MESA data and save results.
# IMPORTANT: Replace these with your actual paths!

# --- General Settings ---

  input_dir: MIST_synthetic
  output_dir: MIST_synthetic_output
  inlist_name: "inlist_project"

# If you've run a full analysis before and the 'detail_z*.csv' files exist,
# you can set 'force_reanalysis' to 'false' to speed things up.
# If you want to re-run the blue loop analysis from scratch, set it to 'true'.  
  force_reanalysis: True
  debug: True

# --- Analysis Options ---
# Set these to 'true' ONLY for the specific tasks you want to perform.
blue_loop_analysis:

# This is CRITICAL. The blue loop BC plots rely on the detailed
# blue loop analysis data, which is generated when this is 'true'.
# Keep this as 'true' to ensure the necessary data is processed.
  analyze_blue_loop: True

# Defines the columns saved in the detailed blue loop CSV files.
# 'all' saves all columns from the blue loop phase.
# 'summary' saves only key columns (e.g., star_age, log_Teff, log_L).
  blue_loop_output_type: "summary"

# --- Plotting specific settings ---
# Set these to 'true' ONLY for the specific tasks you want to perform.
plotting_settings:

# Set to 'true' to enable heatmap generation.
  generate_heatmaps: True

# This controls the generation of the main HR diagrams.
# Options:
#   - 'default': Generates standard HRDs with full tracks (no ZAMS trimming).
#   - 'drop_zams': Generates HRDs with pre-main sequence (ZAMS) trimming.
#   - (Omit this line entirely or set to null/None): Does NOT generate HRDs.
#
# For standard HRDs, it is set to 'default'. 
  generate_hr_diagrams: "default"
  
# Set to 'true' to generate the blue loop specific
# HRD/CMD/logg-L plots with bolometric corrections.
