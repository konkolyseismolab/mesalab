# example.yaml
# Configuration for mesa_grid_analyzer - example run

# --- Required Input/Output Paths ---
# These are essential for the program to find your MESA data and save results.
# IMPORTANT: Replace these with your actual paths!
input_dir: /path_to_your_data/example/MIST_synthetic
output_dir: /path_to_your_data/MIST_example_output

# Name of the inlist file found in each MESA run directory
inlist_name: inlist_project

# --- Analysis and Plotting Options ---
# Set these to 'true' ONLY for the specific tasks you want to perform.

# This is CRITICAL. The blue loop BC plots rely on the detailed
# blue loop analysis data, which is generated when this is 'true'.
# Keep this as 'true' to ensure the necessary data is processed.
analyze_blue_loop: true

# Set to 'true' to enable heatmap generation.
generate_heatmaps: true

# This flag is for general plots (e.g., if you had other custom plots).
# Currently set to 'true' as requested.
generate_plots: true

# This is what you want! Set to 'true' to generate the blue loop specific
# HRD/CMD/logg-L plots with bolometric corrections.
generate_blue_loop_plots_with_bc: true

# --- HR Diagram Generation (New Format) ---
# This controls the generation of the main HR diagrams.
# Options:
#   - 'default': Generates standard HRDs with full tracks (no ZAMS trimming).
#   - 'drop_zams': Generates HRDs with pre-main sequence (ZAMS) trimming.
#   - (Omit this line entirely or set to null/None): Does NOT generate HRDs.
#
# Since you want standard HRDs, it is set to 'default'.
generate_hr_diagrams: default


# --- Other Settings ---
# If you've run a full analysis before and the 'detail_z*.csv' files exist,
# you can set 'force_reanalysis' to 'false' to speed things up.
# If you want to re-run the blue loop analysis from scratch, set it to 'true'.
force_reanalysis: true

# Defines the columns saved in the detailed blue loop CSV files.
# 'all' saves all columns from the blue loop phase.
# 'summary' saves only key columns (e.g., star_age, log_Teff, log_L).
blue_loop_output_type: summary
