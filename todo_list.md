### SOME THINGS ON THE LIST

config.yaml -- dir paths !!!!

GYRE THINGS -- check paths! the first thing: it should be by default: gyre.in files are written in the input directories, as one may run gyre files from there. not from anywhere... maybe an optional output dir.... yes, but I'm not conviced about its necessity...

the other thing: i forgot :D :(

Ok, and one more thing about gyre: make sure, it can be run just by itself... for that: one should run analyzis. and another one: now it filters blueloop, it should be optional. I mean, it's the main purpose, but maybe it would be useful for someone not to filter, but generate in files for the whole track. who knows...

and another... i forgot. it WAS necessary... oh yes! have an example in file, and read it. not from the code...! 

check --generate-plots
check --generate-hrd ... it seems, that it requires  force-reanalysis, which makes sense, as HRDs are made from history.data...

write example readme.md


add real MESA tracks?

check which are the "key" data in blue_loop_output_type ... -- this needs another name to minimaze the chance for confusion


check MESA version compatibilities...


AND REMOVE DEBUG LINES, or just hide them...

maybe: remove dependencies from the setup file... what more?

readme.md: maybe i should mention that it was made for my project...


ok, another: remove dir from detail files! just from there! sorted.... files can keep them


update config.yaml with gyre things

GYRE RUN IMPLEMENTÁLÁSA?!
ehhez leírás: GYRE_DIR környezeti változó hozzáadása! ... /gyre/gyre ... itt make, majd a gyre/gyre/bin/gyre-rel lehet futtatni... számomra most már csak az a kérdés, hogy mesadk nélkül megy-e!
