### SOME THINGS ON THE LIST

config.yaml -- dir paths !!!!


check --generate-plots
check --generate-hrd ... it seems, that it requires  force-reanalysis, which makes sense, as HRDs are made from history.data...

write example readme.md√≠


add real MESA tracks?

check which are the "key" data in blue_loop_output_type ... -- this needs another name to minimaze the chance for confusion


check MESA version compatibilities...
