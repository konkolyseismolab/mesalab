## About `mesalab`

`mesalab` is a Python package designed for **processing and analyze of stellar evolution simulations performed with MESA** (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics). It is developed for handling **large grids of simulations**, such as grids with varying stellar mass (M) and metallicity (Z).

The package runs through the workflow of analyzing MESA outputs as follows:

* **Data Collection:** Systematically gathers relevant data across entire simulation grids. This includes:
    * **From MESA `LOGS/history.data` files:** Stellar evolution parameters like *log_g*, *log_Teff*, *log_L*, *star_mass*, *star_age*, *log_R*, *central_h*, and *he4*.
    * **From MESA inlist files:** Initial simulation parameters such as **initial_mass** and **initial_Z**.* **Parameter Linking:** Seamlessly associating GYRE pulsation modes with their corresponding stellar parameters from MESA evolutionary tracks.
* **Data Aggregation:** Consolidating diverse simulation outputs into easily manageable formats (e.g., CSV files).
* **Visualization:** Generating insightful plots such as Hertzsprung-Russell Diagrams (HRDs) and Color-Magnitude Diagrams (CMDs), often enhanced with pulsation properties.

`mesalab` aims to facilitate the research of stellar evolution and asteroseismology by providing robust and flexible tools for handling complex simulation data.
